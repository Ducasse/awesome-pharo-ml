# Machine learning projects in Pharo

This is the list of machine learning projects written in or related to Pharo. If you know of any other projects that should be on this list - feel free to add them and make a pull request. Or create an issue with a link to the project and I will add it myself. Projects are grouped into categories and sorted by aphabet.

## Neural Networks

* **[MLNeuralNetworks](https://github.com/olekscode/MLNeuralNetwork)** - multilayer neural networks. Classification of MNIST handwritten digits.
* **[NeuralNetworks](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~abergel/NeuralNetworks)** - simple neurons, perceptrons, logical gates.

## Deep Learning

* **[Keras bindings](https://github.com/ObjectProfile/KerasWrapper)** - allows to use [Keras](https://keras.io/) functions within Pharo
* **[TensorFlow bindings](https://github.com/PolyMathOrg/libtensorflow-pharo-bindings)** - allows to use [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) in Pharo

## Data Structures

* **[DataFrame](https://github.com/PolyMathOrg/DataFrame)** - tabular data structures for data analysis and machine learning.

## Data Visualization

* **[MatplotLibBridge](https://github.com/juliendelplanque/MatplotLibBridge)** - a bridge to provide the ability to Pharo user to use Python's [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

## Interactive Notebooks

## Applications

* **[ELIZA-Pharo](https://github.com/brackendev/ELIZA-Pharo)** - Pharo Smalltalk implementation of [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the [MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) by [Joseph Weizenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum).
* **[Generating method names](https://github.com/ObjectProfile/GeneratingMethodNames)** - using sequence to sequence recurrent neural networks for neural machine translation of Pharo source code into English. Translating method code into a very short description (1-5 words) which is a method name.
