# Machine learning projects in Pharo

This is the list of machine learning projects written in or related to Pharo. If you know of any other projects that should be on this list - feel free to add them and make a pull request. Or create an issue with a link to the project and I will add it myself. Projects are grouped into categories and sorted by aphabet.

## Neural Networks

* [MLNeuralNetworks](https://github.com/olekscode/MLNeuralNetwork) - multilayer neural networks. Classification of MNIST handwritten digits.
* [NeuralNetworks](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~abergel/NeuralNetworks) - simple neurons, perceptrons, logical gates.

## Data Structures

* [DataFrame](https://github.com/PolyMathOrg/DataFrame) - tabular data structures for data analysis and machine learning.

## Applications

* [Generating method names](https://github.com/ObjectProfile/GeneratingMethodNames) - using sequence to sequence recurrent neural networks for neural machine translation of Pharo source code into English. Translating method code into a very short description (1-5 words) which is a method name.
